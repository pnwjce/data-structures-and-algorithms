# FizzBuzzTree

# Challenge Summary
Learning how to change the value of nodes in a Binary Tree

## Challenge Description
* Write a function called `FizzBuzzTree` which takes a tree as an argument.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
    * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
* Return the tree with its new values.

## Approach 
Intially, as is depicted in the photo, I wrote out the traversal long form. But have since revised with methods written for other CC's.
